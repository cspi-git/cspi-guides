Find a site<br>Easily find a site, I don't know any methods though we can use this domain for an example; example.com<br><br>&gt; 2. Find the Domain Provider or Host<br>We want to find the Domain Provider or Host to take down the site as they have permissions to take a site down. We're able to find the Domain Provider or Host by using some basic tools, ICANN or many other sites that we will list can find site information, most will say "Domain Registrar" which is the service they're using to Register<br>Domains from.<br><br>How we can do this is by going to one of these 2 sites which are very popular:<br>- https://lookup.icann.org/ - Very popular, Probably the best because they own and register all domains<br>- https://www.whois.com/whois - Very popular, It's really good at finding the register for a domain too<br>- https://www.namecheap.com/domains/domain-name-search/ - They can identify their own sites so dw.<br><br>&gt; 3. Report it to a host<br>Alright, this step kind of sucks but it does work, if you found that the site is using "Freenom", they'll probably not take any action doing so but they may do it because of a new lawsuit that has happened, wont go in depth in this though.<br><br>If the site's registers provider is one of these then you can report the site:<br>- domains.google (registrar-abuse@google.com - Shoot a Email to them for reporting a site)<br>- godaddy (go.co also this, https://supportcenter.godaddy.com/AbuseReport)<br>- register.com (https://newfold.com/abuse)<br>- name.com (https://www.name.com/abuse)<br>- .tech (https://get.tech/report-abuse)<br>- namecheap (I don't know their domain report but you can do it)<br><br>And probably any other host, you can report them to their report pages which you can find under all of the pages. After you done this, don't DDoS the site until they confirm that the URL or User has been "Blacklisted". If they deny that then DDoS the site with a Service<br><br>&gt; 4. Profit?</p></div><script src="/assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script></body></html>
