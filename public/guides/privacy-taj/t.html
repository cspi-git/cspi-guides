"Early planned attacks are good or making traps parallels ahead of your enemy is good.", if you want to have fun while protecting your privacy, you can use misinformation mostly if you are in some tight positions in protecting your privacy. Misleading your enemy, isn't that really hard, it's all about knowing what they might or will check.<br><br><strong>Here is a quick example:</strong><br>So you are a hacker from a hackers forum but for some reason people hate you because of the way you talk, and somehow you noticed that some people may be trying to dox you, but you already know you have secured your privacy on that subject but want to make it interesting.<br><br>Probably since you are on a hackers forum, you already know how to think like a hacker and know what the boxers will do first in finding you. If not, it's very obvious the first thing or instinct that they will have to search for is your username.<br><br>Second, they will scrape and look deeply in your profile and stuff like content and possible emails but since you have secured your or this subject, you don't worry about it, because they will find nothing but dead-ends. Now to make it interesting, you can just post some fake information about you in pastes websites that they might visit or other stuff.
