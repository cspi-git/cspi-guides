Knowing how to manage and take control of all your accounts is one of the ways to not get doxxed or get tracked online. But it requires a lot of discipline.<br /><br /><strong>1. Linking Connections and Differences</strong><br />The first step you should take is to know the connections of your accounts to each other and their differences, such as personal or not. For my part I use flowchart.fun to link my accounts much easier and I have my own style or structure that I can understand.<br /><br />So first, list all the accounts that you use or know even if you don&#39;t use them but they are or can be related to your account, then categorized them by their subject, such as personal, for hacking, non personal, and etc.<br /><br />After that, make a diagram or graph them like connect them based on recovery email, phone number, and etc somehow, just like I said for my part I use flowchart.fun a free flowchart website or you can also write in your notebook and just like draw lines on their connections.<br /><br /><strong>Here is an example</strong>:<br /><img src="/assets/img/supports/a0.png" width="50%" height="50%"></img><br /><br /><strong>2. Securing</strong><br />Now that you know the connections between your accounts, we are going to need to secure them and separate them based on their subject.<br /><br />For example, let&#39;s say you have an account and it&#39;s subject is personal and another one for hacking and the hacking subject is you use it for your hacking activities while the personal for your daily life but then, after connecting your accounts connection you made a blunder and used your personal account gmail to your hacking subject account and that subject you use it for illegal stuff.<br /><br />Don&#39;t panic but your doom, so what you must do is if the website you are using in the hacking subject does not permanently delete logs like if you change your email, names and it logs their old one, then the best you can do is delete that account and hopefully they are honest with their <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> then make a new one but now separate it with your personal subject gmail.<br /><br /><strong>3. Clearing Traces</strong><br />Now that you have secured your accounts and their connection. You know, need to check each and every one of them for breaches and possible traces online that can be used to link them **outside the box**.<br /><br />In this part you should not be naive and let your emotions and feelings control you, like you are in a hacking forum and you are having a good time messaging some hackers saying where they possibly live and stuff. Don&#39;t do that or don&#39;t say your real location; you can either say to them, &quot;Can&#39;t say it for privacy reasons&quot; or you can use deception.<br /><br />Anyways, now the first step you are going to take is to search every single of your emails online using a search engine, of course, like Google and Bing. you must think like a hacker or a doxer and what would they do. While searching every single one of them and you find a link, don&#39;t try to assess that problem, yet, but first you must search every single of your emails online first and take note.<br /><br />After taking notes, what you have to do now is visit all those websites 1 by 1, and if you can&#39;t delete the data or content that shows a link between accounts, then contact their support.<br /><br /><strong>Websites you can use for finding breaches</strong>:<br />- https://intelx.io/<br />- https://haveibeenpwned.com/<br />- https://dehashed.com/ - Paid<br /><br /><strong>4. Clearing Garbages</strong><br />Now that you have cleared every possible traces that you can find, to reduce privacy risk, again check all of the accounts that you have used today (present) and the past and just delete all the accounts that you do not use to reduce privacy risk.<br /><br /><strong>5. Summary</strong><br />Just imagine the connections of each of the things that you do on the internet &amp; cut them off, and for fun try to find yourself, and act as the FBI or Doxer, and simulate their stuff and see you If find sensitive information about yourself (Then remove those traces that you found).<br /><br /><strong>Extra</strong><br />- Use random names in each of your accounts to make it hard for people to link them.<br />- Do not always use major emails like Protonmail and Google in most services; instead use a temporary email because it&#39;s a lot better and can reduce **accounts management &amp; control**, temporary email = less problem because they are temporary.</p><h5 id="b" style="color: #FCFCFC;border-bottom-style: solid;-webkit-text-stroke: 0.8px black;display: inline-block;padding-right: 25px;">Taking advantage of USB live booting</h5><p style="color: rgb(184,182,182);"><strong>What is USB live booting?</strong><br>"USB live booting" refers to the process of booting an operating system directly from a USB drive, rather than from a hard drive or other storage device. This allows a user to use a computer with a different operating system than the one installed on the hard drive, or to use a standalone operating system without installing it on the computer's hard drive.<br><br><strong>Why is this great and how to take advantage of it?</strong><br>You see, one of the reasons this is a great way to have an almost perfect anonymous identity or clear your tracks and second it's because it's portable and stored only on the USB, not in your computer. You install Linux on it; you hack and leak a website database; you exit the live boot and completely format the USB or hid the USB. Boom, the traces are gone. Make sure it's not persistent though.<br><br><strong>Scenario Example:</strong><br>You installed a Linux in your USB, then you used it for the the entire day to hack and you have encountered a database leak in a very popular website and because you are evil you decided to leak it.<br><br>Now there are a lot of risks here; your hacking and leaking of the database can be traced back to you and formatting your entire computer is such a time wasting and may leave traces. So this is the reason USB live booting is great, after you leaked the database from a VPN or Tor. You can just use a command to destroy the entire current OS, then exit safely, remove the USB, then all traces are gone and left to the USB. But you can just completely format the USB to erase the left traces.</p></div><script src="/assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script></body></html>
