First of all, we need to know where to store them securely and how to access them both online and offline. To summarize everything in this guide, we'll back it up both physically and digitally, where it's easily accessible regularly. Accounts Manager used here is <strong>Bitwarden</strong>.<br><br><strong>Here is the backup diagram:</strong><br><img src="/assets/img/supports/b0.png" width="50%" height="50%"><br><br><strong>So all you have to do is:</strong><br>1. Put all your credentials or accounts in <strong>Bitwarden</strong> not limited to credit cards.<br>2. Make a constant schedule where you export the Bitwarden credentials. I recommend every week, after export place it on your USB or main drive (I don't recommend on internal drives).<br>3. After putting it in your USB, backup, create an account on <strong>Icedrive</strong> and <strong>Mega.nz</strong> since that's enough you won't really need the <strong>Proton Drive</strong> but if you want to make sure you can do that too.<br>4. Make sure the passwords are <strong>complex</strong> yet easy to remember and the email used is new and not used or attached to any platforms, only for the backups themselves, I recommend writing the email and passwords in a paper.<br>5. Strengthen the security of your accounts on Icedrive, Mega.nz and so on. But I don't recommend adding <strong>2FAs </strong>on cloud services&nbsp;so it's easily accessible.<br>6. Back up the exported file to these cloud services as well.<br>7. Finally, <strong>delete the exported file</strong> that isn't a copy (I recommend shredding it if possible).<br><br><strong>Recommended Bitwarden settings:</strong><br>- Don't forget to enable&nbsp;<strong>Check known data breaches for this password</strong>.<br>- Make sure KDF iterations is set to&nbsp;<strong>1000000 </strong>or on what iteration your PC can handle but make sure It's high.<br>- 2FA, just write the recovery codes on a paper.<br>- Don't enable&nbsp;<strong>Also rotate my account's encryption key </strong>because It's unnecessary.<br>- Vault timeout to <strong>5 Minutes</strong> and action as <strong>Lock</strong>.</p></div><script src="/assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script></body></html>
